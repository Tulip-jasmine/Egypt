      <h1>Food in Egypt</h1>
      <p>These are some of my favourite Egyptian foods!</p>

        <h2>Kushari</h2>
        <p>
          Carb overload coming right at you! Come lunch time in Cairo you’ll
          see a stack of locals lined up at every kushari shop around, waiting
          for a hearty portion of one of Egypt’s favourite street foods. This
          filling meal is made up of rice, macaroni and lentils, topped with
          tomato sauce, garlic vinegar and garnished with chickpeas and fried
          onions. It’s a perfect meal that is substantial, nutrient-packed and
          cheap. Exactly what the Egyptians were after!
        </p>

        <h2>Ful wa Ta’meya</h2>
        <p>
          Ta’meya and ful mudammas, which are essentially fava beans and
          falafel are the original Egyptian fast-foods. They’re a staple of
          the Egyptian diet, mainly because they’re filling and use
          ingredients that are easily accessible in the country. The ful is
          made of fava beans that are cooked for hours in a pot called a
          qedra. The ta-meya, which is an Egyptian falafel, is made out of
          crushed fava beans that is later made into a paste, then fried.
          Nowadays you can find falafels all over the Middle East however,
          Egypt is the actual origin of those delightful fried treats. A
          perfect dish for all you vegos!
        </p>

        <h2>Mahshi</h2>
        <p>Mahshi is one of the main platters in Egyptian banquets specially in Ramadan when friends and family gather to have iftar at
           sundown. It is by far the most common dish in Egypt and the Middle East along with the Koshari . It is an inexpensive meal - 
           if you did not serve meat with it- so it is eaten by the poor and the rich in Egypt.
           Mahshi is basically veggies stuffed with rice mixture. It has been always a rocket science for me, 
          specially the stuffed grape leaves and cabbage rolls , as they require some skills in rolling them. 
          But once you get the hang of it, you will stuff almost any veggies you like just give it a try and you will see for your self 
          ... It is an addicting process
        </p>
        
        <h2>Om Ali</h2>
        <p>
         Om Ali is an Egyptian classic as old as time,
           gets an upgrade with the use of delightfully delicious PALMIERS (lunettes) instead of regular ‘ol puff pastry or roaa 
           (Egyptian flat bread).  Oodles of crushed palmiers get mixed with nuts, sweetened hot milk, 
           topped with whipped cream  and broiled to perfection.  
          The result…crunchy and caramelized on top, deliciously creamy and silky in the bottom.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Molokhia</h2>
        <p>Molokhia is another popular dish in Egypt. It is an appetizer and comes in the form of soup. 
          If you love eating a bowl of soup before your meal, you must try Molokhia or Mulukhiyah.
           It is made up of Jute Mallow leaves that are minced and cooked deliciously in herb-infused broth. 
           Mostly, this soup tastes like a spinach soup, 
           but just with a blast of flavorsome local herbs and spices infused within the broth. 
           Molokhia is extremely healthy and is especially good if you are a vegetarian traveling to Egypt.
